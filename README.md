# Crypto Dashboard Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the Crypto Dashboard! This website provides users with real-time tracking of popular cryptocurrencies, a comprehensive market index, and a dashboard for future personalization features. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and mobile-responsive.

## Features

### 1. **Search Functionality (In Development)**

- Users can press the search icon, located in the **bottom right**, to look up different cryptocurrencies.
- Currently, this feature is still in development and will be enhanced in future versions.

### 2. **Recent Viewed Coins**

- A **recently viewed** section helps users keep track of the cryptocurrencies they were last viewing.
- This allows for easy navigation and quick reference to frequently checked coins.

### 3. **Real-Time Cryptocurrency Listings**

- The main interface displays a selection of key cryptocurrencies, including:
  - **Bitcoin (BTC)**
  - **Ethereum (ETH)**
  - **Solana (SOL)**
  - **Dogecoin (DOGE)**
- These coins are presented with their latest market data, allowing users to stay updated on their performance.

### 4. **Massive S&P BDM (Broad Digital Market Index)**

- This feature tracks the overall performance of cryptocurrencies over the years.
- It serves as a comprehensive market index that reflects the state of the crypto market.

### 5. **Data Fetching and React Query**

- The data is fetched from **CoinGecko**, one of the leading sources for real-time cryptocurrency market data.
- This project utilizes **React Query**, which simplifies data fetching, caching, and state management.
- I chose **React** because itâ€™s a framework that makes development easier, and it aligns well with my experience in frontend development.

### 6. **Dashboard for Future Enhancements**

- A sidebar dashboard has been integrated into the interface.
- While currently minimal, future implementations will include:
  - **Personalization Features**: Customizable user preferences.
  - **Organization Tools**: Improved tracking and management options for cryptocurrencies.
- Due to time constraints, these features have not been fully implemented yet but are planned for future updates.

### 7. **Mobile-Friendly Interface**

- The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Users can seamlessly navigate and view market data on their smartphones or tablets.

## Challenges Faced

- **Time Constraints**: Balancing this project with other commitments was tough. I had to squeeze in as much development time as possible, even when I was busy.
- **Could Have Done More**: While I did my best, I know I could have done better with more time.
